              <p>We where founded in 2009, where me and a few other's banded together to form a company that will help artist's and bands have a chance to perform live to the real world. We discussed this quite often during our chats online, and from than on expanded overtime that we decided to hire more members of our teams. Our team started to increase as we began our career in this industry, and have been an amazing experience to watch artist's new, and veteran perform live. It was our passion to let them get a taste of the experience that other performers have done, and that it will truly inspire them to keep going.</p>
